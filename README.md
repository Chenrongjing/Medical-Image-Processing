Recognizing and Refining the location of Individual Vessels in Segmented Retinal Images - A Matlab implementation


The various steps involved are:

1. Finding the Optic Disc

2. Skeletonization to trace out the significant edges 

3. Identifying the junction points among the vessels

4. Determining the optimal forest of the vessels

5. Finding the diameter of the vessels
